A python application for batch processing H5 diffraction datasets.

Caker is a utility app which can read a large number of H5 files and produce the processed files (including cake files) and place them in the TEMP folder for PeakPo.
One can run Caker over lunch or dinner time for a large dataset, then PeakPo data analysis can be much faster.
